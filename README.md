Hi,


1-  SharePoint is my back-end for my application which provide a URL pointing to the attachments field. SharePoint only provide 1 field per table to contain
    attachment/s. (I don't recommend using SharePoint as a back-end database for security reasons i've faced but it can be a good source of data).

2- I'm using SQL statements to render the required data from my SharePoint table, but you should be able to provide a SQL or rst from a local database of online or even a table in
    your access file.

3- The above module is using variables related to the database i was working on which includes Expatriate Employees database, so this info. will make sense when reading the code.
    
4- As part of my search and self-learning I found this was tricky to solve at some point in the past, and I hope it provides smoothness in your application performance .
